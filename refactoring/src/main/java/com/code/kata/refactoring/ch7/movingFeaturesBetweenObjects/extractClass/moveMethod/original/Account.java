     * Move Method
     * A method is, or will be, using or used by more features of another class than on witch it is defined.
     * Create a new method with similar body in the class it uses most.Either turn the old method into a simple delegation,
     * or remove it altogether.
     * Motivation
     *   Moving methods is the bread and butter of refactoring. I move methods when classes have too much behavior or when
     * classes are collaborating too much and too highly coupled. By moving method around, I can make the classes simpler and
     * they end up
